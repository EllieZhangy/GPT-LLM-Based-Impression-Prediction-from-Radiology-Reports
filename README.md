# GPT-LLM-Based-Impression-Prediction-from-Radiology-Reports

This research paper presents a novel large language model specifically fine-tuned on radiology reports. The model has been designed to generate accurate impressions by leveraging patients' medical findings and background information. The primary objective of this model is to assist physicians in optimizing their documentation process, ultimately reducing the time required for generating comprehensive reports. By employing this technology, physicians can potentially alleviate the risk of burnout associated with extensive and repetitive documentation tasks.

## Data
The data for this project was obtained from the University of Chicago Medicine, consisting of 789,280 de-identified radiology reports.
